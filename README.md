The way that I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is to expect for what the program is going to be used for to make sure it meets all the requirements. I use comments to make sure that it is readable by anyone, and it makes it faster to be able to locate the exact part of the code that need changed or modified. The way that I make sure it is adaptable is by using the most up to date practices and use functions that can be used and modified. Other ways to use CRUD in the future are for other database applications that can create, read, update, and delete items. The way that I approach a problem is by breaking it down into pieces then being able to solve it one step at a time rather than trying to solve the big problem all at once. That is how I approached the Grazioso Salvare request I created the create function first then the read function then the update and the delete and tested each one after it was made then tested the other functions to make sure they were working correctly. A project like this would help a company like Garzioso Salvare save time while looking for the dogs to train. To be able to select which disaster that they are wanting to train for then to have it narrow down the results from thousands to 10’s would make it so much easier.
